## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  a function is a codeblock that preforms a task given an optionally specified input

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  function keyword, followed by the name of the function, followed by () containing the parameters needed to run the function, followed by { to open the codeblock, followed by the codeblock itself, OPTIONAL return statement, and closed with a }

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  the function name, followed by ( ) containing the arguements, if parameters are needed

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  a function call uses only the function name and a specified parameter if needed,
  Whereas the definition creates the function, creates the parameters needed, and provides details of what it to happen when the parameters are given.

TLDR - a call preforms the action that is specified in the definition

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  a parameter refers to what should be specified when eventually calling the function, whereas an arguement is the specific value when the function is called

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  parameters allow multiple different values to be substitued into a single codeblock, allowing for reuse throughout a program.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  a return statement immediately ends the functions codeblock, and returns a value we can use to the program.
